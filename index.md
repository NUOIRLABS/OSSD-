# OSSD™ — Omnidirectional Superconducting Spherical Drivetrain  
**NU·OIR LABS | Loren D. James**

Frictionless, tri-axial superconducting drivetrain architecture for true 360° mobility — from wheelchairs to autonomous platforms to next-generation propulsion.

---

## What this is
OSSD uses magnetic flux pinning between cryogenic superconductors (YBCO, MgB₂) and permanent magnets arranged in spherical configurations.  
That creates a stable, near-frictionless suspension that can translate and rotate in any direction.

Think: no casters, no wheels fighting you, no scrub, no drag.

## Why it matters
- **Assistive mobility:** Less strain on the user. Lower push force. Smoother navigation over real surfaces, not just perfect labs.
- **Autonomous robotics:** True holonomic motion without complicated multi-wheel steering.
- **Magnetically assisted propulsion concepts:** High-agility attitude control and maneuvering without traditional mechanical steering linkages.

---

## Core System Elements
- **Omnidirectional Sphere Assembly (YBCO / MgB₂):**  
  Flux-pinned spherical bearing system for 6-DOF stability.

- **Cryogenic Cooling Loop:**  
  LN₂ containment + refill port for continuous superconductor operation.

- **Stator & Coil Rings:**  
  Electromagnetic drive interface that can generate linear and rotational thrust.

- **Control Gimbal & Sensors:**  
  Real-time vector control of force, lift, and orientation.

## Prototype Direction: CryoCaster™
OSSD is first being applied to *CryoCaster™* — a superconducting front-end caster assist module for manual wheelchair users.

**Goals:**
- Reduce hand/wrist strain from caster drag.  
- Improve maneuverability on carpet, thresholds, rough flooring.  
- Add powered assist without converting the entire chair to 200+ lb of batteries and motors.
