# OSSD – Omnidirectional Superconducting Spherical Drivetrain

**NU·OIR LABS | Loren D. James**

Flux-pinned, tri-axial superconducting drivetrain architecture designed for omnidirectional, frictionless mobility platforms — from wheelchairs to vehicles and robotics.

## Overview
The OSSD system uses magnetic flux pinning between cryogenic superconductors (YBCO, MgB₂) and permanent magnets arranged in spherical configurations. This creates a stable, frictionless suspension capable of omni-directional movement.

## Core Components
- **Omnidirectional Sphere Assembly (YBCO/MgB₂)** – Flux-pinned bearing system for 6-DOF stability.  
- **Cryogenic Cooling Loop** – LN₂ containment and refill port for continuous superconductor operation.  
- **Stator & Coil Rings** – Electromagnetic drive interface generating linear and rotational thrust.  
- **Control Gimbal & Sensors** – Real-time vector adjustment of magnetic alignment and lift.  

## Applications
- Mobility platforms (CryoCaster™, wheelchairs, drones)  
- Autonomous robotics  
- Magnetic propulsion vehicles  
- Space-based maneuvering systems
