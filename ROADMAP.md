# NU·OIR LABS | OSSD Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Proof of Concept (Current Stage)
**Objective:** Demonstrate flux-pinning stability and load-bearing lift at small scale.  
- Build single-pod cryogenic test using YBCO and NdFeB array.  
- Validate levitation gap stability >8 mm under 10–15 kg load.  
- Document results (photos, data, lift vs. temp curve).  
- Public GitHub publication (for transparency and validation).  

**Funding Targets:**  
- NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR Phase I)  
- DOE EnergyTech Small Grant (Cryogenic Energy Storage)  
- VA Rehab R&D (assistive mobility focus)

### Phase 2 – Prototype Assembly
**Objective:** Integrate four pods into a stable platform base (assistive mobility frame).  
- Add load distribution frame and battery-assisted linear actuators.  
- Begin regulatory path under Class I (medical assistive device).  
- Estimated build cost: $4,500–$6,200.  

---

### Phase 3 – Functional Demonstrator
**Objective:** Controlled demo for NSF and investor review.  
- Add safety mode (mechanical contact legs).  
- Integrate thrust vector sensors and user joystick input.  
- Generate media assets for public demonstration.  

---

### Phase 4 – Commercial Pilot
**Objective:** Partner with hospital, rehab center, or assistive mobility org.  
- Produce 3–5 beta units.  
- Gather clinical performance data.  
- Apply for SBIR Phase II or NSF STTR partnership.

### Long-Term Vision
**OSSD → CryoCaster → NU·OIR Mobility Line**
- Wheelchair casters → gurneys → robotics → industrial movers → vehicles.
- Goal: frictionless motion at every scale.
